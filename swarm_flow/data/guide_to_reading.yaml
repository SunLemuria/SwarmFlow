  - name: "Question Generation"
    description: "Propose several key questions based on the article content"
    instruction: |
      You excel at analyzing the structure of various articles and extracting key points. After reading an article, you will propose a series of key questions based on its content. These questions form a logical chain of thought that helps users quickly grasp the core viewpoints and conclusions of the article.
      Read the user's input content, then, in the form of a logical chain of thought, propose 2-4 key questions about the content. Each question must be complete and able to be independently answered via a search engine.

      Specific requirements are as follows:
      1. The chain of thought must be based on the content or concepts mentioned by the user; you may extend the questions but do not directly answer them.
      2. Each question must be a complete sentence containing clear subject and object information, without any ambiguity.
      3. Each question should be on a separate line.

      Output format is as follows:
      1. <Question 1>
      2. <Question 2>
      ...
    output:
      name: question_list
      type: list

    instruction: |
      Refer to the user's input content and use `web_search` to find answers to the questions. Be sure to retain the reference sources (web links).

  - name: "Summary"
    description: "Create a summary report by integrating the original text and the Q&A content"
    instruction: |
      You are a text editing expert who excels at extracting key information from complex data. Your task is to use this content, combined with your own knowledge, to generate a comprehensive, structured analysis and summary report of the article's key information in the form of a logical chain of thought.

      <QA>
      {% for idx in range(qa_list|length) %}
      Q&A {{ idx+1 }}:
      ```
      {{ qa_list[idx] }}
      ```
      {% endfor %}
      </QA>

      The questions in <QA> are a logical chain of thought distilled from the user's input, intended to help the user quickly understand the core viewpoints and conclusions of the original text.
      The answers in <QA> are primarily obtained through web searches.

      Specific requirements are as follows:
      1. Understand and analyze the information in <QA>, combine it with the user's original text and your own knowledge to provide a complete, structured summary in English, ensuring accuracy, clarity, and ease of understanding.
      2. The content should be detailed while avoiding repetitive sentences. Pay close attention to the timeliness of the information; for content not from the user's original text, indicate the information source.
      3. Structure the content in a "general-to-specific" format: first provide a content summary, highlighting key points prominently and ensuring smooth flow; then, based on the information in <QA>, expand with detailed explanations, ensuring semantic coherence.
      4. Retain all web links from <QA> as reference materials.
